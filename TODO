3.4 changelog
-------------

  * The exchange between different regions (materials) does not default to 0 anymore, but to the harmonic mean of exchange lengths in 

  * It is now default behavior to clear a pre-existing output directory (-f flag is on by default). Run mumax3 -f=0 to get the old behavior (refuse to run with non-empty output directory).

  * Some obsolete command line flags like -bl -bx -by have been dropped

minor changes:

  * Internally, the coordinate system has been converted to right-handed. This should be transparent to the user unless low-level functionality is accessed.
However, make sure you also update mumax3-convert.



bugs:
-----

remove dump output, hack mumax3-convert to accept dump002 properly, but deprecate

mumax3-convert -o does not work

energy density presumably not correct

omf/ovf does not check if enough bytes are read

JPEG output

MFM 3D not OK

need proper zhang-li boundary conditions

reduce operations are non-reproducible, though OK within numerical precission.

check output of all mumax3-convert formats

script: compile selector?

upon resize auto refresh dispaly quits working

setexlen not ok, also api, output

replace TableData by averageable

API:
----

review getcell()

q.average()

mask.setv, getv

check region defined?


improvements:
-------------

cleanup LValue interface, M should not have to implement it.

save self-defined variable.

resettable tables, multiple tables?

MFM: don't crash on tip crash ;-), just zero kernel

kernel cache

DMI in 3D

optimization for small simulatons? one big multi-FFT on all components, one big kenrel mul?

master process assigns ports (clean fail if port in use, start new instance on next port?) and GPU
	web iface of master shows que?
	mumax3 -que add to que, return?


cuda.HostBuffer() for faster I/O

non-fatal error handling for GUI

log.FatalErr: print line number of caller?


new features:
-------------

web: (clean) exit button
web: show/hide/auto refresh

PACKAGE

package main
    import "github.com/barnex/mumax-daemon/submit"

    submit can be used to submit jobs to a mumax-daemon que. submit takes a
    flag describing the kind of job file to make and a number of input
    files. E.g.:

	submit --mumax2 *.py

    This will generate JSON job files in the user's que directy. Default is
    $HOME/que, can be overridden with --que flag.

    The job files are in simple JSON and may as well be written by hand or a
    script, if more flexibility is needed.

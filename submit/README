PACKAGE

package main
    import "github.com/barnex/mumax-daemon/submit"

    submit can be used to submit jobs to a mumax-daemon que. submit takes a
    flag describing the kind of job file to make and a number of input
    files. E.g.:

	submit --mumax2 *.py

    This will generate corresponding JSON job files in the user's que
    directy. Default is $HOME/que, can be overridden with --que flag. The
    que directory should be accessible by the daemons.

    The job files are simple JSON encodings of the Job data type and may as
    well be written by hand or a script, should more flexibility be needed.
    E.g.:

	{"Command":"mumax2","Args":["-gpu=%GPU","job.py"],"Wd":"/home/me/myfiles"}

    Jobs can be removed from the queue by simply deleting the job files from
    the queue directory. See the daemon documentation for more info.

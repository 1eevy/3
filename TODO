3.4 changelog
-------------

  * JPol (spin polarized current density) had to be split in quantities J (current density) and Pol (spin polarization). This allows material dependent spin-polarization and opens the possibility for Oersted-AmpÃ¨re fields. Existing input files will need to replace "JPol" by "J". Pol defaults to 1 so does not need to be set explicitly.

  * A fix for the nvidia TITAN gpu has been issued, it can now safely be used.

  * The exchange between different regions (materials) does not default to 0 anymore, but to the harmonic mean of exchange lengths in 

  * Some obsolete command line flags like -bl -bx -by have been dropped

minor changes:

  * Internally, the coordinate system has been converted to right-handed. This should be transparent to the user unless low-level functionality is accessed.
However, make sure you also update mumax3-convert.





bugs:
-----

need proper zhang-li boundary conditions

reduce operations are non-reproducible, though OK within numerical precission.

API:
----

check region defined?

improvements:
-------------

MFM: also work with PBC (simple kernel change)
MFM: don't crash on tip crash ;-), just zero kernel

DMI: also work with PBC


remove -f flag, move existing files to name.old
fprintln: put file in OD if not absolute

master process assigns ports (clean fail if port in use, start new instance on next port?) and GPU
	web iface of master shows que?
	mumax3 -que add to que, return?


cuda: shift: memeset, don't clamp
cuda.HostBuffer()
non-fatal error handling for GUI
log.FatalErr: print line number of caller?


new features:
-------------

web: (clean) exit button
web: show/hide/auto refresh
web: -web flag opens browser


windows:
--------
go msi installer from golang.org

git from git-scm.com
* Run Git from the windows command prompt
* Checkout as-is

mingw-w64 from mingw.org > sourceforge

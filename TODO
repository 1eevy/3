3.4 changelog
-------------

  * JPol (spin polarized current density) had to be split in quantities J (current density) and Pol (spin polarization). This allows material dependent spin-polarization and opens the possibility for Oersted-AmpÃ¨re fields. Existing input files will need to replace "JPol" by "J". Pol defaults to 1 so does not need to be set explicitly.

  * A fix for the nvidia TITAN gpu has been issued, it can now safely be used.

  * Cubic anisotropy has been fixed (Thanks Damien Louis)

  * The exchange between different regions (materials) does not default to 0 anymore, but to the harmonic mean of exchange lengths in 

  * It is now default behavior to clear a pre-existing output directory (-f flag is on by default). Run mumax3 -f=0 to get the old behavior (refuse to run with non-empty output directory).

  * Some obsolete command line flags like -bl -bx -by have been dropped

minor changes:

  * Internally, the coordinate system has been converted to right-handed. This should be transparent to the user unless low-level functionality is accessed.
However, make sure you also update mumax3-convert.



bugs:
-----

always using 3D convolution

MFM 3D not OK

need proper zhang-li boundary conditions

reduce operations are non-reproducible, though OK within numerical precission.

check output of all mumax3-convert formats

omf/ovf does not check if enough bytes are read

script: compile selector?

upon resize auto refresh dispaly quits working

setexlen not ok, also api, output

API:
----

mask.setv, getv

check region defined?


improvements:
-------------

save self-defined variable.

resettable tables, multiple tables?

MFM: don't crash on tip crash ;-), just zero kernel

kernel cache

DMI in 3D

master process assigns ports (clean fail if port in use, start new instance on next port?) and GPU
	web iface of master shows que?
	mumax3 -que add to que, return?


cuda.HostBuffer()
non-fatal error handling for GUI
log.FatalErr: print line number of caller?


new features:
-------------

web: (clean) exit button
web: show/hide/auto refresh
web: -web flag opens browser


windows:
--------

    mumax-daemon is a tool to run (primarily) mumax simulations on a
    cluster.

    The "daemon" executable should be run on the compute nodes. Jobs can be
    submitted with the "submit" command or by manually adding JSON job files
    to a queue directory.

    See the documentation of daemon and submit for individual details.
